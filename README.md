# Election-Analysis
## 1. Overview of Election Audit
We are tasked with analyzing an election and outputting results for our client
We use python to navigate the data and slowly piece together a way to search through each ballot
The votes are counted, and we then provide a platform to print the results.

## Election-Audit Summary
This is a good baseline for an election given a similar csv file with similar information. It could be tweaked to add certain things like a Political Party, or perhaps be expanded to an election with more than 3 candidates and counties without much change. The code is well fitted for any amount of candidates or counties as it adds in when a new one is read, so it would be easily fitted for either a small scale election with many candidates, or a primary with a large number fighting for an election spot. Another way it could be modified is for a board election, we can edit it to name more than one winner if necessary and print that out.
